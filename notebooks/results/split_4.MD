Azure Cognitive Search is well suited for the following application scenarios:  
 Consolidate heterogeneous content into a private, user-defined search index.  
 Offload indexing and query workloads onto a dedicated search service.  
 Easily implement search-related features: relevance tuning, faceted navigation, filters (including geo-spatial search), synonym mapping, and autocomplete.  
 Transform large undifferentiated text or image files, or application files stored in Azure Blob Storage or Azure Cosmos DB, into searchable chunks. This is achieved during indexing through cognitive skills that add external processing.  
 Add linguistic or custom text analysis. If you have non-English content, Azure Cognitive Search supports both Lucene analyzers and Microsoft's natural language processors. You can also configure analyzers to achieve specialized processing of
:unselected: :unselected: :unselected: :unselected:
raw content, such as filtering out diacritics, or recognizing and preserving patterns in strings.
